# BEACON_R20Sheet

Some useful references:

the raw of the thing I started working from https://github.com/Anduh/Roll20-grid-template/tree/master/simple-template

The Google Sheet for BEACON, which format we're loosely adapting here

<b><i>Near-term goals/wants:</b></i>

Surge roll that tracks surge level

NPC generic actions (NPC shove, grapple, recover, etc.)

Is there a way to format the roll template so that if an input is blank, it doesn't show the line on the output?
In theory something here: https://wiki.roll20.net/Building_Character_Sheets/Roll_Templates or here https://gist.github.com/joesinghaus/28173990b3235365f6e13fb9f834aa5d should help with this goal

Better header

Reducing wasted space would be nice, every time I try to play with e.g. column width the whole sheet kind of borks

<i><b>Mid-term goals/wants:</b></i>

Better format for Talents - that box is going to get huge as people level up

Color-code outputs based on type (skill, spell, weapon, trait, talent, support)

Better fonts

Alternate spellcaster focused sheet that swaps position of Attacks box and Powers box?
