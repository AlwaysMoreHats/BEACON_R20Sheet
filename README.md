Some useful references:

the raw of the thing I started working from https://github.com/Anduh/Roll20-grid-template/tree/master/simple-template

examples of how to do something close to what we want for attacks rolls, ctrl-f "Attacks & Spellcasting" https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/5e%20Darker%20Dungeons

The Google Sheet for BEACON, which format we're loosely adapting here

Near-term goals/wants:
Better fonts
Better header
There's a few places (mostly in the Attacks box, but I think at least one other place) with a mix of Label and Span - the mix
  is working in terms of formatting line breaks and stuff, but it would be good if the text was the same size/bold in places where they intermix
Reducing wasted space would be nice, every time I (Tim) try to play with e.g. column width the whole sheet kind of borks

Tim fix NPC roll issue
